          <p>Hi, my name is Yvonne and welcome to my website!</p>
          <p>While brainstorming for the topic of my midterm website project, the first thing I came up with was the Super Mario Games that I played in my childhood. I remembered that I love the game so much that my free time was restricted on playing Mario games by my parents because I was too obsessed with the game and did not study for my exams at school. Therefore, I decided to introduce Super Mario and share some of my experience with it. </p>

            Mario is a fictional character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario video game franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, starting with Mario's Game Gallery and later Super Mario 64.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. Mario has also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment, and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He will be voiced by Chris Pratt in the upcoming 2022 film adaptation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mario is one of the most famous characters in the video game industry and an established pop culture icon. Mario's likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media. With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.

              Mischievous ghosts who often appear in dark, abandoned places.

              <p>
              They may be spooky ghosts, but they're also incredibly shy. They will freeze in place and cover their eyes if someone looks right at them.

              Donkey Kong can hurl giant barrels with the greatest of ease, and is so powerful the ground shakes when he pounds on the ground.

            <p>When I was in elementary school, my dad bought a home video play console called Wii and a mario kart game as my birthday gift. This was a really exciting thing for me at the time since my parent's rarely let me watch any cartoons on TV when I was young. Therefore, my journey with Super Mario began from then on.<br><br>
            Among the various courses in Mario Kart Wii, I like the Bowser's Castle course the most. In my perspective, Bowser's Castle has the most competitive routes of all courses. The longer you play, the more likely you are to find secret routes, which are uncertain but more adventurous, more interesting, and sometimes shorter than the original routes.</p>

            Although Nintendo DS started prevailing among children at the same age as me well before I actually own one, I was still amazed by the dual interacting screen when I got my NDS. My first game was abosolutely the Super Mario Series, however, this time it wasn't the Mario Kart game but the Mario Party DS. This game has a storyline and includes many minigames that players have to play in order to pass through the games. I used to play Mario Party with my best friends at school and we are never bored playing the game. It occupied am important part in my childhood memory.
